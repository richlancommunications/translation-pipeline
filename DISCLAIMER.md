# Disclaimer

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a **reference implementation** that demonstrates my approach to building specialized translation systems. It showcases the methodology, architecture, and workflows I use when developing translation solutions for clients.

## Not a Finished Product

This codebase is:
- ✅ A demonstration of technical capabilities
- ✅ A showcase of domain expertise (medical, biblical, African languages)
- ✅ A foundation for discussing custom requirements
- ✅ An example of my development approach

This codebase is **not**:
- ❌ A plug-and-play production system
- ❌ Fully tested enterprise software
- ❌ A complete commercial product
- ❌ Maintained as open-source software with SLA

## Production Deployments

**For actual client projects, I provide:**
- Customized implementations based on specific requirements
- Security hardening and compliance measures
- Integration with existing systems and workflows
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation tailored to the organization
- Ongoing support and maintenance options
- Confidentiality and data protection agreements

Each production deployment is adapted to:
- Client's specific language pairs and domains
- Security and privacy requirements
- Integration architecture
- Volume and performance needs
- Quality assurance standards
- Budget and timeline constraints

## Code Quality & Metrics

**Performance metrics** mentioned in this repository (such as accuracy rates, processing speeds, or confidence scores) are:
- Illustrative examples based on typical use cases
- Not guaranteed for all content types or language pairs
- Dependent on glossary quality and coverage
- Subject to variation based on content complexity

Actual performance in production systems depends on:
- Quality and comprehensiveness of domain glossaries
- Specific content characteristics
- Translation engine configuration
- Hardware and network resources

## Use of This Code

You are welcome to:
- Review the code to understand my approach
- Use concepts and patterns in your own work (per MIT License)
- Contact me about custom implementations
- Reference this work when discussing projects

Please note:
- This code is provided "as is" without warranty
- Production use requires customization and testing
- I do not provide free support for self-hosted implementations
- Client work is performed under separate agreements

## Client Confidentiality

This public repository:
- Does **not** contain any client data or proprietary glossaries
- Does **not** include production configurations or API keys
- Uses generic examples for demonstration purposes only
- Maintains strict separation from confidential client work

All actual client projects are:
- Developed under appropriate confidentiality agreements
- Stored in private repositories
- Subject to data protection requirements
- Never publicly disclosed without explicit permission

## Services vs. Code

**This repository demonstrates technical approach.**
